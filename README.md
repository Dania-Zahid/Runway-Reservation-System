# Runway-Reservation-System
A C++ console-based Runway Reservation System that allows scheduling and managing airplane landing times using Binary Search Tree (BST) as the underlying data structure. The system ensures that no two landings violate a k-minute separation rule and provides efficient reservation management using DSA concepts.
